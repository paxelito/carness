The Gillespie class contains the information concerning the Gillespie algorithm propensity with other useful information. In particular it has 4 properties, namely mol\-\_\-\-I, mol\-\_\-\-I\-I, mol\-\_\-\-I\-I\-I, mol\-\_\-\-I\-V containing the species I\-D's related to different species type according to the different admitted reactions. In the following a table summarizing the different meanings for the different reactions is reported. \begin{TabularC}{6}
