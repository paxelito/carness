 The {\bfseries Catalytic Reactions Network Stochastic Simulator (Ca\-R\-Ne\-S\-S)} is a computational model devoted to the simulation of theoretical complex catalytic networks composed of different interacting molecular species. The model takes inspiration from the original model proposed by Kauffman in 1986, and describes systems composed of molecular species interacting by means of two possible reactions only, cleavage and condensation. One polymer is divided into two short polymers in the former case while two polymers are glued together forming a longer polymer in the latter case. Each reaction must be catalyzed by another species in the system to occur, and one of the assumptions is that any chemical has an independent probability to catalyze a randomly chosen reaction. It is important to notice that there are not indications about the chemical nature of the molecules, species \char`\"{}\-A\char`\"{} may be both a polipeptide, an amminoacid, a particular protein domain or an R\-N\-A strenght.\par

 \hypertarget{intro_sysreq}{}\section{System Requirement}\label{intro_sysreq}


 In order to have the simulator run correctly the recommended staff is reported\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Mac\-Os\-X 10.\-4 or later, Linux (or in general a system U\-N\-I\-X based) or Windows O\-S (tests have been performed on Win7 and win Vista) as well
\item G\-C\-C (G++) compiler, or similar, installed (if you need to compile the software on your machine)
\end{DoxyItemize}

On Mac\-Os system compile using {\ttfamily g++} -\/\-Wall -\/ansi -\/lm -\/o Ca\-R\-Ne\-S\-S $\ast$.cpp \par

 \hypertarget{intro_parameters}{}\section{Input Parameters \-:: acsm2s.\-conf}\label{intro_parameters}


 All the system parameters are stored in a file called {\bfseries acsm2s.\-conf}. Anyone can create his own configuration file paying attention to put \char`\"{}=\char`\"{} char between the parameter name and the the parameter value (N\-O S\-P\-A\-C\-E B\-E\-T\-W\-E\-E\-N T\-H\-E\-M).\par
 Notice that the simulator does not create the initial structures but it simply loads the structures created by an external software and process them. Nevertheless the configuration file is fundamental to supply all the parameters to the simulation (during the simulation new entities may be created). The simulator is provided with a structures initializator developed in M\-A\-T\-L\-A\-B language by the group (a description of the initializator is provided in the main file \char`\"{}start.\-m\char`\"{}) in which all the parameters we are going to describe are used to create the initial structures. All parameters are reported below divided in three categories\-: \begin{DoxyVerb}          - System
          - Environment
          - Dynamic

          Categories are useful only to help users in the parameter recognition within the configuration file. They are not handled from the software, if you like you can rearrange configuration file as you prefer, notice only that comments have to start with character <i>"#"</i>. Within the source code folder an example of the acsm2s.conf file is provided.<br>
 The following parameters are used both by the initializator and the simulator. Nvertheless it is ALWAYS necessary having a complete configuration file even if the structures have been already created.
