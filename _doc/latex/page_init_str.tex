In order to proceed with the simulation the system needs from {\bfseries 4} to {\bfseries 6 (open system and energy on)} initial data structures files (an example for each file is located into the source code folder)\-: \begin{DoxyVerb} - \c acsm2s.conf (described in the \ref parameters section)
 - \c _acsspecies.csv - This file contains all the initial <b>species</b> with their proprieties
 - \c _acsreactions.csv - This file contains all the initial <b>reactions</b> with their proprieties
 - \c _acscatalysis.csv - This file contains all the <b>correspondances between species and reactions</b> with their proprieties
\end{DoxyVerb}


and, if the system is open \begin{DoxyVerb} - \c _acsinflux.csv - This file contains all the species belonging to the incoming flux
\end{DoxyVerb}


and. if the system is energy based \begin{DoxyVerb}          - \c _acsnrgbooleanfunctions.csv - This file contains all the possible boolean functions associated with the reactions
\end{DoxyVerb}
