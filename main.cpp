 * The <b>Catalytic Reactions Network Stochastic Simulator (CaRNeSS)</b> is a computational model devoted to the simulation of theoretical complex catalytic networks composed of different
 * interacting molecular species. 
 * The model takes inspiration from the original model proposed by Kauffman in 1986, and describes systems composed of molecular species interacting by means of two possible reactions only, cleavage and condensation. One polymer is divided into two short polymers in the former case while two polymers are glued together forming a longer polymer in the latter case.
 * Each reaction must be catalyzed by another species in the system to occur, and one of the assumptions is that any chemical has an independent probability to catalyze a randomly chosen reaction.
 * It is important to notice that there are not indications about the chemical nature of the molecules,
 * species "A" may be both a polipeptide, an amminoacid, a particular protein domain or an RNA strenght.<br><br>
 *\section secUsage Using the simulator
 * To run the simulator open a terminal shell and type:<br><br>
 *	\c$path/executiveFile \c<configuration_File_Folder> \c<output_folder> \c<reaction_structures_folder><br>
 *		Examples:
 *      - Unix Based Systems:\c ~/Documents/project/acsm2s \c ~/Documents/.../confFileFolder/ \c ~/Documents/.../resFolder/ \c ~/Documents/.../StructuresFolder/
 *      - Win Systems: \c C:\\Documents\\project\\acsm2s.exe \c C:\\Documents\\...\\confFileFolder\\ \c C:\\Documents\\...\\resFolder\\ \c C:\\Documents\\...\\StructuresFolder\\
 *
 * <br><br>
 * \section sysreq System Requirement
 * <hr>
 * In order to have the simulator run correctly the recommended staff is reported:
 *		- MacOsX 10.4 or later, Linux (or in general a system UNIX based) or Windows OS (tests have been performed on Win7 and win Vista) as well
 *		- QT4 library installed (you can download them from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads, the download is a little bit large)
 *		- GCC compiler, or similar, installed (if you need to compile the software on your machine)
 *<br><br>
 * \section ide IDEs
 * <hr>
 * The QT package contains a very useful and powerful IDE called QT creator in which you can compile and develop your code. Alternatively on Mac Os sytems you can use xCode (http://developer.apple.com/xcode/). To create a valid xCode project it is sufficient, once you have installed the QT libraries, to open the terminal, go into the source code folder and type "qmake -spec macx-xcode QT_acs.pro".<br>
 * <b>ATTENTION!!! A version of the QT libraries specific for MaxOsX Lion (10.7) has not been yet released so it is not possible to create a valid xCode project, nonetheless you can always work on code by means of QT creator software paying attention to add the line "QMAKE_MAC_SDK = /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk" in the QT_acs.pro file</b>
 * <br><br>
 * \section parameters Input Parameters :: acsm2s.conf
 * <hr>
 * All the system parameters are stored in a file called <b>acsm2s.conf</b>. Anyone can create his own configuration file paying attention to put "=" char between the parameter name and the the parameter value (NO SPACE BETWEEN THEM).<br>
 * Notice that the simulator does not create the initial structures but it simply loads the structures created by an external software and process them. Nevertheless the configuration file is fundamental to supply all the parameters to the simulation (during the simulation new entities may be created).
 * The simulator is provided with a structures initializator developed in MATLAB language by the group (a description of the initializator is provided in the main file "start.m") in which all the parameters we are going to describe are used to create the initial structures.
 * All parameters are reported below divided in three categories:
 *
 *		- System
 *		- Environment
 *		- Dynamic
 *
 *		Categories are useful only to help users in the parameter recognition within the configuration file. They are not handled from the software, if you like you can rearrange configuration file as you prefer, notice only that comments have to start with character <i>"#"</i>. Within the source code folder an example of the acsm2s.conf file is provided.<br>
 *      The following parameters are used both by the initializator and the simulator. Nvertheless it is ALWAYS necessary having a complete configuration file even if the structures have been already created.

 * \page pageInitializator The initializator (a very brief description)
 * The initializator provided with the simulator is located in the \c initializator folder (within the source code folder) and it is developed in Matlab code. All the parameters are set in the \c start.m file (from line 22 to line 63). In addition you find the parameters related to the name of the folder that will contain the simulation (\c simFolder.name), the path where that folder will be created (\c simFolder.path) and the number of different network ensambles to create (\c simFolder.nets). It is important to notice that the initializator has not been thought to be shared, so it is not too much user friendly to be manipulated. Nevertheless it could be very useful with a little bit of practice.
 *  \section initSensitivity Screening Parameter
 * To initialize structures to perform a sensitivity analysis of a specific parameters follow the following instruction:
 *  - Change the name of the array at row 13 with the name of the parameter you want analyze. This array contains the values of the paramter. Remember to insert the old parameter you are changing in the parameters list with its single value, otherwise it would be a missing parameter.
 *  - In the array at row 14 (\c nome_folder) you have put the same number of elements of the array containing the screening values. This array contains a numeric tag of the values (used to create the simulations folder names) contained in the values array.
 *  - In the code of the \c start.m file (rows 122 to 150) you must change:
 *      - row 121: \c [rows,b]=size(reactionProbability); --> [rows,b]=size(name_of_the_parameter_you_have_trasformed_in_array);
 *      - row 146: \c inizializzatore_ACS(... reactionProbability(i), ...); -> inizializzatore_ACS(... name_of_the_parameter_you_have_trasformed_in_array(i), ...); (remember to remove the index to the reactionProbability parameter
