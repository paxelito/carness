This repository contains analysis scripts devoted to the study and the characterization of the simulations carried out by means of the CARNESS simulator. 

FILES: 
- acsAttractorAnalysis.py -> Comparison between distinct final states 
- acsAttractorAnalysisInTime.py -> Comparison between distinct states in time
- acsSCCanalysis.py -> Strongly connected components analysis
- acsSpeciesActivity.py -> Count how many times a species is a substrate, a catalyst or a product
- acsStateAnalysis.py -> Comparison between different times in the same run. Agglomerative statistics are computed as well
- acsDynStatInTime -> Trajectory in concentrations of each species are detected
- init.py system initializator
- prepareNewSim.py -> prepare the initial conditions of a new simulation starting from the final conditions of an other sim.
